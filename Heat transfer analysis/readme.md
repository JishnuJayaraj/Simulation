# Numerical Analysis of Heat Transfer from Porous Fin

This project was done in ANSYS as Bachelors project. The objective of this project was to optimize the heat transfer from a fin using different fin structure. 

The surface area of fin was varied using different diameter holes. The task was to optimize the heat transfer via both conduction and convection at same time
